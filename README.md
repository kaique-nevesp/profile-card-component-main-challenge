## üöÄ Overview

This project was a big challenge for me, especially because of the background and the profile picture positioning. I'm proud of the final result, but I know there's still plenty of room for improvement. So, I'm completely open to suggestions and feedback on how I can keep getting better.

## My process

### üõ†Ô∏è Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### üí° What I learned

I learned a lot about image and background positioning using CSS. One of the main challenges was placing the profile picture on top of another image with a border, and I solved it using the margin property. While it worked, I realize there might be more elegant or scalable approaches. I'm planning to explore alternatives, such as using position, transform, or even flexbox and grid to achieve the same result more efficiently.

üß© Code Highlights for me

```html
<li class="counter">
          <p class="number">80K</p>
          <p>Followers</p>
        </li>
```
```css
.profile-info img {
    border-radius: 50%;
    width: 100px;
    border: 4px solid #ffffff;
    margin-top: -52px;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
}
```

### üß† Continued development

I plan to keep improving my Flexbox skills, as I feel there‚Äôs still a lot of room for growth, especially when it comes to positioning images and centering elements within cards or containers.
